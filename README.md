# Drag-n-drop between windows

This example shows you how you can drag and drop elements from one browser window (or tab) to another.
To get started with this example follow these simple steps:

1. clone the repo and go into the directory with a shell
2. `npx http-server -c-1`
3. open a browser and go to the address provided by step 2.
4. open another window or tab and repeat step 3.
5. click the button a few times
6. Start dragging and dropping

## why

Whilst talking to a colleague from the UX department she expressed how cool it would be to drag items between different browser windows.
She was amazed when I told her that it was possible, and quite easy, with the newer drag-n-drop browser APIs and asked me if I could make a little example.
And if you know me at all... I'm always keen to show new cool stuff... so here's the little demo I made :)
